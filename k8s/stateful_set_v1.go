// StatefulSetV1 StatefulSet represents a set of pods with consistent identities. Identities are defined as:   - Network: A single stable DNS and hostname.   - Storage: As many VolumeClaims as requested.  The StatefulSet guarantees that a given network identity will always map to the same storage identity.
