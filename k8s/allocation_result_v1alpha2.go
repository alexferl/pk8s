type AllocationResultV1alpha2 struct {
	AvailableOnNodes *NodeSelectorV1 `json:"availableOnNodes,omitempty"`
	// ResourceHandles contain the state associated with an allocation that should be maintained throughout the lifetime of a claim. Each ResourceHandle contains data that should be passed to a specific kubelet plugin once it lands on a node. This data is returned by the driver after a successful allocation and is opaque to Kubernetes. Driver documentation may explain to users how to interpret this data if needed.  Setting this field is optional. It has a maximum size of 32 entries. If null (or empty), it is assumed this allocation will be processed by a single kubelet plugin with no ResourceHandle data attached. The name of the kubelet plugin invoked will match the DriverName set in the ResourceClaimStatus this AllocationResult is embedded in.
